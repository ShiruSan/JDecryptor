The internal encryption method is an own encryption process based on shuffling the alphabet and some special characters.
The result depends on the seed, because the hashcode of it is used in the random algorithm to shuffle the characters.
It's a simple encryption method which is difficult to revert without the original seed.

Advantages:
- simple low-effort encryption
- encrypted text is very difficult to decrypt without seed

Disadvantages:
-
